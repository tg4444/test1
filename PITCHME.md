## OWT-1: Service Oriented Architecture (SOA)

Abstract 
```
Service-oriented architecture (SOA) is an approach used to create an architecture based upon the use of services. Services carry out some small function, such as producing data, validating a customer, or providing simple analytics. The basic principles of service-oriented architecture are independent of vendors, products and technologies. A service is a discrete unit of functionality that can be accessed remotely and acted upon and updated independently.

---

According to SOA, a service has the following properties:
- It logically represents a business activity with a specified outcome.
- It is self-contained.
- It is a black box for its consumers.
- It may consist of other underlying services.

---

Since the definition of SOA does not enforce any technological standards, its implementation can take many forms, such as the following:
- OSGi Services
- ESBs
- REST APIs

This tutorial intends to:
1. Examine the general SOA principles.
2. Illustrate possbile SOA implementations.
3. Discuss SOA best practices.
